            <div id="inner_subheading">Password to follow…</div>
            <div id="inner_subcontent">Sending the password in a separate email is something that everyone has either done, or had done to them. As though sending TWO clear text transmissions to the same network and account or worse yet from the same network and account is somehow better than just placing them in the same email.</div>

			<div id="inner_subcontent">What is the basic thought process with this? If someone is running a MiTM it won’t help to send two emails unless they are generously spaced out, and even then this is not a guarantee. If someone has access to the mailbox, the sent items folder is just as feature rich a target as the inbox is, and depending on the mailbox this may be more so. For example an administrator that handles password resets. This sent items folder can potentially hold numerous valid and active account credentials. So what is the benefit?</div>

			<div id="inner_subcontent">In short it is a visual crutch of safety. Like the TSA security checks for post security issues, this does little to avert the underlying risks. Instead a complete out of band solution should be used. The options here are many, but some preferable ones are wholly separate email infrastructures, SMS, and escrowed encryption solutions.</div>

            <div id="inner_subheading">Digital Collateral Damages</div>
            <div id="inner_subcontent">One recent day a discussion that began with remote car starters, and quickly moved to smart phone insecurities and theft unearthed a phrase heard frequently in response to security suggestions. “I don’t care if they steal my phone and read my email, I have nothing to hide.”  Not caring is one thing, but thinking there is nothing worth stealing inside that phone is another.</div>

			<div id="inner_subcontent">The typical smart phone is not pin protected. The unlock instructions are clear and concise, and the actual lock is meant to prevent accidental pocket dials versus ensuring privacy remains. This means that all the SMS entries and personal photos are available for viewing. Calendar entries stating when others or even the phone owner are on vacation may be present. Contact information many times including addresses is trivial to extract as well. If the theft of the phone is an indication, a thief having an address and a known empty house should be a big concern. This brings up and interesting point about personal disclosure responsibility. An ethical discussion for later, but what about that email?</div>

			<div id="inner_subcontent">As this particular conversation unfolded, the recent Twitter hack was mentioned. How the password reset function was exploited through re-registering an old and unused address, and having the freshly reset password sent to this. The gears were starting to turn when the question of what email account is registered with your bank was posed. Yes, that is right, the security of your banking relies upon the “slide to open” bar on that iPhone.</div>

			<div id="inner_subcontent">Seeing the collateral impact of event is not always clear. The ripple effect is always in play which is why exercising even moderate best practices throughout the day can make a significant difference when it counts. Security is always as good as the weakest link. As the digital existence expands and blends more time needs to be spent on awareness. Far too many don’t understand the risks they face, and until they do, they will never properly protect themselves.</div>
