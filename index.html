	    <p>
	    Dealing with Internet attacks has become a fact of doing business online. However, many 							companies are unsure how to protect themselves, or even what the risks actually are. Many companies put off defending themselves until it is too late.

		<p>Password to follow…</p>
		<p>Sending the password in a separate email is something that everyone has either done, or had done to them. As though sending TWO clear text transmissions to the same network and account or worse yet from the same network and account is somehow better than just placing them in the same email.</p>

		<p>Digital Collateral Damages</p>
		<p>One recent day a discussion that began with remote car starters, and quickly moved to smart phone insecurities and theft unearthed a phrase heard frequently in response to security suggestions. “I don’t care if they steal my phone and read my email, I have nothing to hide.”  Not caring is one thing, but thinking there is nothing worth stealing inside that phone is another.</p>

		<p>State Privacy Laws</p>
		<p>Massachusetts recently passed 201 CMR 17 which is titled the “Standards for the Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth”. This important piece of legislature, set to begin January 2010, is a big step in state and local compliance laws. Currently, most state laws are reactive. This means that they require disclosure in the event of a breach, but rarely mandate active or proactive protections.</p>

        <!--<h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>-->

<!--<p>This is my test...This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>-->

<!--<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name-->
<!--$ git fetch origin-->
<!--$ git checkout gh-pages-->
<!--</code></pre>-->

<!--<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>-->

<!--<h3>Designer Templates</h3>-->

<!--<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>-->

<!--<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>-->

<!--<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>-->

<!--<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>-->

<!--<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>-->
